Important
---------------------------------------
Please be aware that mintypublish is **in pre-alpha** and as such is not feature-complete, is buggy and is *definitely* not recommended for usage in a production environment

Getting started
---------------------------------------
* Make sure where you're installing mintypublish into has at least PHP 5.2.0 and MySQL (unsure on version)
* Copy everything in the `trunk` folder to where you want mintypublish to be installed
* Go into `trunk/mintypublish/config.php` and edit the MySQL settings as appropriate
* Use a script such as phpMyAdmin to run the `db_dump_mysql.txt` file
* Go to where you've installed mintypublish, and bask in the glory!
* To get the administration tools, go to `index.php?p=admin`
